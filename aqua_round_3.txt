To find the cost price of the article, we need to understand that the selling price (SP) is 20% more than the cost price (CP). The selling price is given as Rs.360.

Let's denote the cost price as CP. According to the problem, the selling price is 20% more than the cost price, which can be expressed as:

SP = CP + 20% of CP

This can be rewritten as:

SP = CP + 0.2 * CP
SP = 1.2 * CP

We know that SP = Rs.360, so:

1.2 * CP = 360

To find CP, we divide both sides by 1.2:

CP = 360 / 1.2
CP = 300

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300. The correct option is:

B)300

So, the answer is B.

----- Negative side -----
I actually agree with your calculation and reasoning. The selling price (SP) is indeed 20% more than the cost price (CP), and the equation you used is correct:

SP = 1.2 * CP

Given that SP = Rs.360, you correctly solved for CP:

1.2 * CP = 360
CP = 360 / 1.2
CP = 300

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300. The correct option is:

B)300

So, the answer is B.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill. Let's denote:

- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

We have two equations based on the given information:

1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800
   \]

2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040
   \]

We can solve these two equations to find \( F \) and \( V \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]
\[
80V = 240
\]
\[
V = 3
\]

Now, substitute \( V = 3 \) back into the first equation to find \( F \):
\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]
\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]
\[
F = 180
\]

Now that we have \( F = 180 \) and \( V = 3 \), we can calculate the bill for 500 calls:
\[
\text{Bill} = F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3
\]
\[
\text{Bill} = 180 + 1500 = 1680
\]

Therefore, the bill for the month with 500 calls would be Rs.1680. The correct option is:

B

   - Total wages for 15 days = 15 days * $90/day = $1350.

2. **Total wages for the first 7 days:**
   - The average wage for the first 7 days is $87 per day.
   - Total wages for the first 7 days = 7 days * $87/day = $609.

3. **Total wages for the last 7 days:**
   - The average wage for the last 7 days is $92 per day.
   - Total wages for the last 7 days = 7 days * $92/day = $644.

4. **Wage on the 8th day:**
   - The total wages for the 15 days include the first 7 days, the 8th day, and the last 7 days.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ways we can select 3 candy bars such that their total cost is more than $4. 

First, let's list the possible combinations of candy bars and their costs:

- 50 cents each: 3 candy bars
- $1 each: 4 candy bars
- $2 each: 4 candy bars

We need to find combinations where the total cost exceeds $4. 

1. **All three candy bars cost $2 each:**
   - Total cost = $6
   - Number of ways = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

2. **Two candy bars cost $2 each and one costs $1:**
   - Total cost = $5
   - Number of ways to choose 2 candy bars costing $2 = \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\)
   - Number of ways to choose 1 candy bar costing $1 = \(\binom{4}{1} = 4\)
   - Total number of ways = \(6 \times 4 = 24\)

3. **Two candy bars cost $2 each and one costs 50 cents:**
   - Total cost = $4.50
   - Number of ways to choose 2 candy bars costing $2 = \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\)
   - Number of ways to choose 1 candy bar costing 50 cents = \(\binom{3}{1} = 3\)
   - Total number of ways = \(6 \times 3 = 18\)

2. **Two candy bars cost $2 each and one costs $1:**
   - Total cost = $5
   - Number of ways to choose 2 candy bars costing $2 = \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\)
   - Number of ways to choose 1 candy bar costing $1 = \(\binom{4}{1} = 4\)
   - Total number of ways = \(6 \times 4 = 24\)

3. **Two candy bars cost $2 each and one costs 50 cents:**
   - Total cost = $4.50
   - Number of ways to choose 2 candy bars costing $2 = \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\)
   - Number of ways to choose 1 candy bar costing 50 cents = \(\binom{3}{1} = 3\)
   - Total number of ways = \(6 \times 3 = 18\)

Adding these possibilities together, we get the total number of ways to select 3 candy bars with a total cost of more than $4:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made from 28 white tulips and 98 red tulips, ensuring that no flowers are left out. This means we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers, 28 and 98.

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - The prime factorization of 28 is \(2^2 \times 7\).
   - The prime factorization of 98 is \(2 \times 7^2\).

2. **Finding the GCD:**
   - The GCD is found by taking the lowest power of all prime factors present in both numbers.
   - For the prime number 2, the lowest power is \(2^1\).
   - For the prime number 7, the lowest power is \(7^1\).

3. **Calculate the GCD:**
   - Therefore, the GCD of 28 and 98 is \(2^1 \times 7^1 = 2 \times 7 = 14\).

Thus, the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made is 14. Each bouquet will have \(28/14 = 2\) white tulips and \(98/14 = 7\) red tulips.

The correct answer is D)14. Therefore, the response is:

To determine the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased, we need to consider the cost constraints and the prices of the trousers and shirts.

1. **Price of each trouser**: Rs 70
2. **Price of each shirt**: Rs 30
3. **Total money available**: Rs 810

Let's calculate the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased:

- If the man buys only trousers, the maximum number he can buy is \( \frac{810}{70} \approx 11.57 \). Since he can't buy a fraction of a trouser, the maximum whole number of trousers he can buy is 11.

Now, let's check if buying 11 trousers is feasible:

- Cost of 11 trousers = \( 11 \times 70 = 770 \)
- Remaining money = \( 810 - 770 = 40 \)

With Rs 40 remaining, he can buy \( \frac{40}{30} \approx 1.33 \) shirts, which means he can buy 1 shirt.

Thus, when the maximum number of trousers (11) is purchased, he can buy 1 shirt.

The ratio of trousers to shirts is 11:1.

Therefore, the correct option is E) 11 Trousers.

Let's denote the wholesale cost of the appliance as \( W \).

The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost, so it can be expressed as:
\[ R = W + 0.6W = 1.6W \]

The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. Therefore, the selling price \( S \) is:
\[ S = R - 0.2R = 0.8R \]

Substituting the expression for \( R \):
\[ S = 0.8 \times 1.6W = 1.28W \]

Now, we need to find out what percent more the selling price \( S \) is than the wholesale cost \( W \).

The increase in price from the wholesale cost to the selling price is:
\[ S - W = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \]

To find the percentage increase over the wholesale cost:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left(\frac{0.28W}{W}\right) \times 100\% = 28\% \]

To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of an arithmetic progression (A.P.).

1. **Understanding the A.P.**:
   - The ages of the members are in A.P. with a common difference of 3 months, which is 0.25 years.
   - The youngest member is 7 years old, so the first term \( a = 7 \).

2. **Sum of the A.P.**:
   - The sum of the ages of all members is given as 250.
   - The formula for the sum of an A.P. is:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (2a + (n-1)d)
     \]
   - Here, \( S_n = 250 \), \( a = 7 \), and \( d = 0.25 \).

3. **Setting up the equation**:
   \[
   250 = \frac{n}{2} \times (2 \times 7 + (n-1) \times 0.25)
   \]
   \[
   250 = \frac{n}{2} \times (14 + 0.25n - 0.25)
   \]
   \[
   250 = \frac{n}{2} \times (13.75 + 0.25n)
   \]
   \[
   500 = n \times (13.75 + 0.25n)
   \]
   \[
   500 = 13.75n + 0.25n^2
   \]
   \[
   0.25n^2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0
   \]

4. **Solving the quadratic equation**:
   - Multiply the entire equation by 4 to eliminate the decimal:
   \[
   n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0
   \]
   - Use the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 55 \), and \( c = -2000 \).

5. **Calculating the discriminant**:
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = 55^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025
   \]
   - The square root of 11025 is 105.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the rectangular parking space. We know that one side is unpainted and its length is 9 feet. The sum of the lengths of the three painted sides is 37 feet.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle as \( L \) and the width as \( W \). Without loss of generality, assume the unpainted side is the length \( L = 9 \) feet. This means the two widths and one length are painted. Therefore, the equation for the sum of the painted sides is:

\[ W + W + L = 37 \]

Substituting \( L = 9 \) into the equation, we have:

\[ 2W + 9 = 37 \]

Solving for \( W \), we subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2W = 28 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ W = 14 \]

Now we have the dimensions of the rectangle: length \( L = 9 \) feet and width \( W = 14 \) feet.

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:

\[ A = L \times W = 9 \times 14 = 126 \]

Now, we have the dimensions: length \( L = 9 \) feet and width \( W = 14 \) feet.

Let's denote the original number of friends as \( x \).

Initially, each friend was supposed to contribute \( \frac{96}{x} \).

After 4 friends did not turn up, the number of friends who attended the picnic became \( x - 4 \).

Now, each of these remaining friends had to contribute \( \frac{96}{x - 4} \).

According to the problem, the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, so:

\[
\frac{96}{x - 4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4
\]

Let's solve this equation:

\[
\frac{96}{x - 4} - \frac{96}{x} = 4
\]

To solve this, find a common denominator:

\[
\frac{96x - 96(x - 4)}{x(x - 4)} = 4
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
\frac{96x - 96x + 384}{x(x - 4)} = 4
\]

\[
\frac{384}{x(x - 4)} = 4
\]

Multiply both sides by \( x(x - 4) \):

\[
384 = 4x(x - 4)
\]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[
96 = x(x - 4)
\]

\[
x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0
\]

Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -96 \).

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-96)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 384}}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{400}}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 20}{2}
\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[
x = \frac{24}{2} = 12
\]

or

\[
x = \frac{-16}{2} = -8
\]

Since the number of friends cannot be negative, \( x = 12 \).

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is \( x - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \).

A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was Choose one of the following options: ['A)8', 'B)12', 'C)16', 'D)24', 'E)25']. The response should end with a single uppercase letter.

----- Base Answer -----
Let's denote the original number of friends as \( x \).

Initially, each friend was supposed to contribute \( \frac{96}{x} \).

After 4 friends did not turn up, the number of friends who attended the picnic became \( x - 4 \).

Now, each of these remaining friends had to contribute \( \frac{96}{x - 4} \).

According to the problem, the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, so:

\[
\frac{96}{x - 4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4
\]

Let's solve this equation:

\[
\frac{96}{x - 4} - \frac{96}{x} = 4
\]

To solve this, find a common denominator:

\[
\frac{96x - 96(x - 4)}{x(x - 4)} = 4
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
\frac{96x - 96x + 384}{x(x - 4)} = 4
\]

\[
\frac{384}{x(x - 4)} = 4
\]

Multiply both sides by \( x(x - 4) \):

\[
384 = 4x(x - 4)
\]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[
96 = x(x - 4)
\]

\[
x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0
\]

Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -96 \).

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-96)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 384}}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{400}}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 20}{2}
\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[
x = \frac{24}{2} = 12
\]

or

\[
x = \frac{-16}{2} = -8
\]

Since the number of friends cannot be negative, \( x = 12 \).

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is \( x - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \).

The correct answer is:

A)8

Let's denote the amount of money Arjun has as \( A \) and the amount Sajal has as \( S \).

According to the first condition: If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.

This can be expressed as:
\[ S + 30 = 2(A - 30) \]
\[ S + 30 = 2A - 60 \]
\[ S = 2A - 90 \]  (Equation 1)

According to the second condition: If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.

This can be expressed as:
\[ A + 10 = 3(S - 10) \]
\[ A + 10 = 3S - 30 \]
\[ A = 3S - 40 \]  (Equation 2)

Now, we solve these two equations simultaneously.

Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:
\[ A = 3(2A - 90) - 40 \]
\[ A = 6A - 270 - 40 \]
\[ A = 6A - 310 \]
\[ 310 = 5A \]
\[ A = 62 \]

Substitute \( A = 62 \) back into Equation 1:
\[ S = 2(62) - 90 \]
\[ S = 124 - 90 \]
\[ S = 34 \]

Therefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34. The correct option is B)62, 34.

B

----- Negative side -----
Let's verify the solution step by step.

We have the following equations based on the problem statement:

1. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun:
   \[
   S + 30 = 2(A - 30)
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   S + 30 = 2A - 60
   \]
   \[
   S = 2A - 90
   \]
   (Equation 1)

2. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal:
   \[
   A + 10 = 3(S - 10)
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   A + 10 = 3S - 30
   \]
   \[
   A = 3S - 40
   \]
   (Equation 2)

Now, let's solve these equations simultaneously.

Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:
\[
A = 3(2A - 90) - 40
\]
\[
A = 6A - 270 - 40
\]
\[
A = 6A - 310
\]
\[
310 = 5A
\]
\[
A = 62
\]

Substitute \( A = 62 \) back into Equation 1:
\[
S = 2(62) - 90
\]
\[
S = 124 - 90
\]
\[
S = 34
\]

Therefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34. The correct option is B)62, 34.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional gallons of orange juice must be added to the existing mixture to make orange juice 60% of the total mixture.

Initially, we have 1 gallon of soft drink, which consists of:
- 40% orange juice = 0.4 gallons
- 60% water = 0.6 gallons

Let \( x \) be the number of additional gallons of orange juice to be added. After adding \( x \) gallons of orange juice, the total amount of orange juice becomes \( 0.4 + x \) gallons, and the total volume of the mixture becomes \( 1 + x \) gallons.

We want the orange juice to be 60% of the total mixture, so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{0.4 + x}{1 + x} = 0.6
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x)
\]
\[
0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x
\]
\[
0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6
\]
\[
0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6
\]
\[
0.4x = 0.6 - 0.4
\]
\[
0.4x = 0.2
\]
\[
x = \frac{0.2}{0.4}
\]
\[
x = 0.5
\]

Therefore, 0.5 additional gallons of orange juice must be added to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink. The correct answer is:

A)0.5

----- Negative side -----
I agree with your solution and reasoning. Let's verify the calculations to ensure accuracy:

Initially, we have 1 gallon of soft drink, which consists of:
- 0.4 gallons of orange juice
- 0.6 gallons of water

We add \( x \) gallons of orange juice, making the total orange juice \( 0.4 + x \) gallons and the total mixture \( 1 + x \) gallons.

We want the orange juice to be 60% of the total mixture:
\[
\frac{0.4 + x}{1 + x} = 0.6
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x)
\]
\[
0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x
\]
\[
0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6
\]
\[
0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6
\]
\[
0.4x = 0.2

\[
x = \frac{0.2}{0.4}

\[
x = 0.5

The calculations confirm that 0.5 additional gallons of orange juice are needed. The correct answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 4 presenters from a team of 4 men and 4 women, with the condition that the group cannot be composed of only men or only women.

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 presenters from the 8 team members (4 men + 4 women):

\[
\binom{8}{4} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 70
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to choose 4 presenters that are all men:

\[
\binom{4}{4} = 1
\]

Similarly, calculate the number of ways to choose 4 presenters that are all women:

\[
\binom{4}{4} = 1
\]

Now, subtract the all-men and all-women groups from the total number of groups:

\[
70 - 1 - 1 = 68
\]

Therefore, the number of different groups of presenters that can be chosen, ensuring that the group is not composed of only men or only women, is 68. However, this number does not match any of the given options. Let's re-evaluate the possible combinations:

Consider the possible combinations of men and women in the group of 4 presenters:

1. 3 men and 1 woman:
   \[
   \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{4}{1} = 4 \times 4 = 16
   \]

2. 2 men and 2 women:
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

3. 1 man and 3 women:
   \[
   \binom{4}{1} \times \binom{4}{3} = 4 \times 4 = 16
   \]

Add these combinations together:

\[
16 + 36 + 16 = 68
\]

The correct number of different groups of presenters that can be chosen is indeed 68, but this does not match any of the provided options. It seems there might be an error in the options provided. However, based on the calculations, the closest option to 68 is not available. Therefore, the correct answer based on the given options is not present. 

If we must choose an option, we should re-evaluate the problem or consider the possibility of an error in the options. However, based on the calculations, the correct answer should be 68, which is not listed. 

Given the options, none of them are correct, but if forced to choose, we would need to reconsider the problem constraints or options. However, based on the calculations, the correct answer is not present in the options. 

Therefore, the answer is not available in the given options. However, if we must choose, we should consider the closest logical option, which is not present.

To determine which value is a multiple of X, where X is divisible by both 9 and 12, we first need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12.

The prime factorization of 9 is \(3^2\), and the prime factorization of 12 is \(2^2 \times 3\). The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^2\).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^2\).

Thus, the LCM of 9 and 12 is \(2^2 \times 3^2 = 4 \times 9 = 36\).

Now, we need to check which of the given options is a multiple of 36:

- A) 36: 36 is a multiple of 36.
- B) 15: 15 is not a multiple of 36.
- C) 17: 17 is not a multiple of 36.
- D) 5: 5 is not a multiple of 36.
- E) 7: 7 is not a multiple of 36.

Therefore, the correct answer is A) 36.

----- Negative side -----
I agree with your reasoning and conclusion. To determine which value is a multiple of X, where X is divisible by both 9 and 12, we indeed need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12.

The prime factorization of 9 is \(3^2\), and the prime factorization of 12 is \(2^2 \times 3\). The LCM is calculated by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^2\).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^2\).

Thus, the LCM of 9 and 12 is \(2^2 \times 3^2 = 4 \times 9 = 36\).

Now, we check which of the given options is a multiple of 36:

- A) 36: 36 is a multiple of 36.
- B) 15: 15 is not a multiple of 36.
- C) 17: 17 is not a multiple of 36.
- D) 5: 5 is not a multiple of 36.
- E) 7: 7 is not a multiple of 36.

Therefore, the correct answer is A) 36.

To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern or logic used to determine the cost of each fruit. Let's examine the given prices:

- Orange: 18 dollars
- Pineapple: 27 dollars
- Grape: 15 dollars

One possible approach is to consider the number of letters in each fruit's name:

- "Orange" has 6 letters, and the cost is 18 dollars.
- "Pineapple" has 9 letters, and the cost is 27 dollars.
- "Grape" has 5 letters, and the cost is 15 dollars.

It appears that the cost is determined by multiplying the number of letters in the fruit's name by 3. Let's verify this:

- Orange: 6 letters × 3 = 18 dollars
- Pineapple: 9 letters × 3 = 27 dollars
- Grape: 5 letters × 3 = 15 dollars

This pattern holds true. Now, let's apply the same logic to "Mango":

- "Mango" has 5 letters.

Using the pattern, the cost would be:

5 letters × 3 = 15 dollars

Therefore, the cost of a mango is 15 dollars. The correct option is:

B) 15 dollars

So, the answer is B.

----- Negative side -----
I agree with your analysis and conclusion. The pattern you've identified is consistent with the given prices, where the cost of each fruit is determined by multiplying the number of letters in the fruit's name by 3. Let's verify this again:

- "Orange" has 6 letters, and 6 × 3 = 18 dollars.
- "Pineapple" has 9 letters, and 9 × 3 = 27 dollars.
- "Grape" has 5 letters, and 5 × 3 = 15 dollars.

Applying the same logic to "Mango," which has 5 letters:

- 5 letters × 3 = 15 dollars.

Therefore, the cost of a mango is indeed 15 dollars. The correct option is:

B) 15 dollars

So, the answer is B.

To solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of the rectangle first and then calculate the perimeter.

Let's denote the breadth of the rectangle as \( b \) meters. According to the problem, the length \( l \) is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth. Therefore, we can express the length as:
\[ l = 4b + 1 \]

The area of the rectangle is given as 150 square meters. The area of a rectangle is calculated as:
\[ \text{Area} = l \times b \]

Substituting the expressions for \( l \) and the given area, we have:
\[ (4b + 1) \times b = 150 \]

Expanding this equation gives:
\[ 4b^2 + b = 150 \]

Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[ 4b^2 + b - 150 = 0 \]

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:
\[ b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \]
where \( A = 4 \), \( B = 1 \), and \( C = -150 \).

Calculating the discriminant:
\[ B^2 - 4AC = 1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401 \]

The square root of 2401 is 49. So, the solutions for \( b \) are:
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8} \]

This gives us two possible solutions:
\[ b = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \]
\[ b = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \]

Since a negative breadth doesn't make sense in this context, we take \( b = 6 \).

Now, substituting \( b = 6 \) back into the expression for the length:
\[ l = 4 \times 6 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \]

With the length and breadth known, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2(l + b) = 2(25 + 6) = 2 \times 31 = 62 \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 62 meters. The correct answer is:
C)62 m

C

----- Negative side -----
I agree with your solution and reasoning. You correctly set up the equations based on the problem statement, solved the quadratic equation to find the breadth, and then used it to find the length. Finally, you calculated the perimeter accurately. The perimeter of the rectangle is indeed 62 meters. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C)62 m

To solve this problem, let's denote the five consecutive two-digit odd numbers as \( n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8 \). The sum of these numbers is:

\[ n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + 20. \]

We are given that when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. Therefore, we have:

\[ \frac{5n + 20}{10} = \text{perfect square}. \]

Simplifying the expression:

\[ \frac{5n + 20}{10} = \frac{5(n + 4)}{10} = \frac{n + 4}{2}. \]

This means \( \frac{n + 4}{2} \) must be a perfect square. Let \( \frac{n + 4}{2} = k^2 \), where \( k \) is an integer. Then:

\[ n + 4 = 2k^2 \]
\[ n = 2k^2 - 4. \]

Since \( n \) is a two-digit odd number, we need to find values of \( k \) such that \( n \) is odd and between 10 and 99.

Let's check the options:

- **A) 47**: If \( n = 47 \), then \( 47 + 4 = 51 \), and \( \frac{51}{2} = 25.5 \), which is not a perfect square.
- **B) 91**: If \( n = 91 \), then \( 91 + 4 = 95 \), and \( \frac{95}{2} = 47.5 \), which is not a perfect square.
- **C) 41**: If \( n = 41 \), then \( 41 + 4 = 45 \), and \( \frac{45}{2} = 22.5 \), which is not a perfect square.
- **D) 67**: If \( n = 67 \), then \( 67 + 4 = 71 \), and \( \frac{71}{2} = 35.5 \), which is not a perfect square.
- **E) 44**: 44 is not an odd number, so it cannot be one of the numbers.

None of the options seem to satisfy the condition directly. However, let's re-evaluate the calculations for any oversight:

Re-evaluating for option **D) 67**:

If \( n = 67 \), then:

\[ n + 4 = 71 \]
\[ \frac{71}{2} = 35.5 \]

This was previously calculated incorrectly. Let's try another approach:

If \( n = 67 \), then the sum of the numbers is:

\[ 67 + 69 + 71 + 73 + 75 = 355. \]

Dividing by 10 gives:

\[ \frac{355}{10} = 35.5, \]

which is not a perfect square. Therefore, let's re-evaluate the options again:

Upon further inspection, it seems there was a miscalculation. Let's try a different approach:

If \( n = 41 \), then:

\[ n + 4 = 45 \]
\[ \frac{45}{2} = 22.5 \]

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total journey duration considering the change in speed after covering a quarter of the distance.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - The train takes 10 hours to reach its destination at a speed of 100 miles/hour.
   - Therefore, the total distance = speed × time = 100 miles/hour × 10 hours = 1000 miles.

2. **Calculate the distance covered before it starts raining:**
   - The train covers a quarter of the total distance before it starts raining.
   - Distance covered before rain = 1000 miles / 4 = 250 miles.

3. **Calculate the time taken to cover the distance before it starts raining:**
   - Time = distance / speed = 250 miles / 100 miles/hour = 2.5 hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Remaining distance = total distance - distance covered before rain = 1000 miles - 250 miles = 750 miles.

5. **Calculate the time taken to cover the remaining distance at the reduced speed:**
   - The train slows down to 75 miles/hour due to rain.
   - Time = distance / speed = 750 miles / 75 miles/hour = 10 hours.

6. **Calculate the total journey duration:**
   - Total journey duration = time before rain + time after rain = 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours.

Therefore, the total journey duration is 12.5 hours. The correct option is C)12.5.

----- Negative side -----
I agree with your calculations and reasoning. Let's go through the steps again to ensure accuracy:

1. **Total Distance Calculation:**
   - The train travels at 100 miles/hour for 10 hours, so the total distance is 1000 miles.

2. **Distance Before Rain:**
   - A quarter of the distance is 1000 miles / 4 = 250 miles.

3. **Time Before Rain:**
   - Time to cover 250 miles at 100 miles/hour is 250 miles / 100 miles/hour = 2.5 hours.

4. **Remaining Distance:**
   - The remaining distance after the rain starts is 1000 miles - 250 miles = 750 miles.

5. **Time After Rain:**
   - The train travels the remaining 750 miles at 75 miles/hour, which takes 750 miles / 75 miles/hour = 10 hours.

6. **Total Journey Duration:**
   - Total time is 2.5 hours (before rain) + 10 hours (after rain) = 12.5 hours.

The total journey duration is indeed 12.5 hours. Therefore, the correct option is C)12.5.

Choose one of the following options: ['A)10', 'B)11.5', 'C)12.5', 'D)13.5', 'E)15']. The response should end with a single uppercase letter.

----- Base Answer -----
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total journey duration considering the change in speed after covering a quarter of the distance.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - The train takes 10 hours to reach its destination at a speed of 100 miles/hour.
   - Therefore, the total distance = speed × time = 100 miles/hour × 10 hours = 1000 miles.

2. **Calculate the distance covered before it starts raining:**

   - Distance covered before rain = 1000 miles / 4 = 250 miles.

3. **Calculate the time taken to cover the distance before it starts raining:**
   - Time = distance / speed = 250 miles / 100 miles/hour = 2.5 hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Remaining distance = total distance - distance covered before rain = 1000 miles - 250 miles = 750 miles.

5. **Calculate the time taken to cover the remaining distance at the reduced speed:**
   - The train slows down to 75 miles/hour due to rain.
   - Time = distance / speed = 750 miles / 75 miles/hour = 10 hours.

6. **Calculate the total journey duration:**
   - Total journey duration = time before rain + time after rain = 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours.

Therefore, the total journey duration is 12.5 hours. The correct option is C)12.5.

To find the actual selling price of the article before the discount, we need to understand that Vinit purchased the article at a 20% discount. This means he paid 80% of the original price.

Let the original price be \( x \).

Given that Vinit paid Rs.4578, we can set up the equation:

\[ 0.8x = 4578 \]

To find \( x \), divide both sides by 0.8:

\[ x = \frac{4578}{0.8} \]

\[ x = 5722.5 \]

Since the options provided are rounded to the nearest whole number, the closest option to Rs.5722.5 is Rs.5723.

Therefore, the actual selling price of the article is Rs.5723.

The correct answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the hollow cube and how the painting affects the smaller cubes.

1. **Structure of the Hollow Cube:**
   - The outer cube has a size of 5cm x 5cm x 5cm.
   - The thickness of the cube is 1cm, meaning there is an inner hollow cube.
   - The inner hollow cube has a size of (5 - 2)cm = 3cm, because the thickness is 1cm on each side.

2. **Number of Smaller Cubes:**
   - The outer cube is made up of 5 x 5 x 5 = 125 smaller cubes of size 1cm x 1cm x 1cm.
   - The inner hollow cube (which is not present) would have been 3 x 3 x 3 = 27 smaller cubes.

3. **Number of Smaller Cubes in the Hollow Structure:**
   - The actual number of smaller cubes in the hollow structure is 125 (total cubes in the outer cube) - 27 (cubes in the inner hollow part) = 98 smaller cubes.

4. **Painting the Outer Surface:**
   - When the outer surface is painted, only the cubes on the outermost layer are affected.
   - The outermost layer consists of the entire 5 x 5 x 5 cube minus the inner 3 x 3 x 3 cube.

5. **Unpainted Faces Calculation:**
   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.
   - Total faces for all 98 smaller cubes = 98 x 6 = 588 faces.
   - The outer surface of the 5 x 5 x 5 cube has 5 x 5 x 6 = 150 faces (since each face of the cube is 5 x 5 and there are 6 faces).

6. **Unpainted Faces:**
   - The number of unpainted faces = Total faces - Painted faces = 588 - 150 = 438.

Therefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 438.

The correct answer is A) 438.

----- Negative side -----
Let's go through the problem step by step to verify the solution.

1. **Structure of the Hollow Cube:**
   - The outer cube is 5cm x 5cm x 5cm.
   - The thickness of the cube is 1cm, so the inner hollow cube is 3cm x 3cm x 3cm.

2. **Number of Smaller Cubes:**
   - The outer cube consists of 5 x 5 x 5 = 125 smaller cubes.
   - The inner hollow cube would have been 3 x 3 x 3 = 27 smaller cubes.

3. **Number of Smaller Cubes in the Hollow Structure:**
   - The actual number of smaller cubes in the hollow structure is 125 (total cubes in the outer cube) - 27 (cubes in the inner hollow part) = 98 smaller cubes.

4. **Painting the Outer Surface:**
   - The outer surface of the cube is painted, which affects the smaller cubes on the outermost layer.

5. **Unpainted Faces Calculation:**
   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.
   - Total faces for all 98 smaller cubes = 98 x 6 = 588 faces.
   - The outer surface of the 5 x 5 x 5 cube has 5 x 5 x 6 = 150 faces (since each face of the cube is 5 x 5 and there are 6 faces).

6. **Unpainted Faces:**
   - The number of unpainted faces = Total faces - Painted faces = 588 - 150 = 438.

Therefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is indeed 438.

The correct answer is A) 438.

To determine the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to calculate the total production cost and the required total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total production cost for the year:**
   - The company produces 420 units per month.
   - The production cost per component is $110.
   - Total production cost per month = 420 units * $110 = $46,200.
   - Total production cost for the year = $46,200 * 12 months = $554,400.

2. **Determine the required total revenue for the year:**
   - The desired yearly profit is $626,400.
   - Required total revenue = Total production cost + Desired profit = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,080,800.

3. **Calculate the required selling price per component:**
   - Total units produced and sold in a year = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units.
   - Required selling price per component = Total required revenue / Total units = $1,080,800 / 5,040 units = $214.29.

Since the selling price must be at least $214.29 to achieve the desired profit, we need to choose the minimum selling price from the given options that is greater than or equal to $214.29.

The options are: A) 226, B) 230, C) 240, D) 260, E) 280.

The minimum selling price that meets the requirement is option A) 226.

Therefore, the answer is A.

   - Total production cost per month = 420 units * $110 = $46,200.
   - Total production cost for the year = $46,200 * 12 months = $554,400.

2. **Determine the required total revenue for the year:**
   - The desired yearly profit is $626,400.
   - Required total revenue = Total production cost + Desired profit = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,080,800.

3. **Calculate the required selling price per component:**
   - Total units produced and sold in a year = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units.
   - Required selling price per component = Total required revenue / Total units = $1,080,800 / 5,040 units = $214.29.

Now, we need to choose the minimum selling price from the given options that is greater than or equal to $214.29.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of men, the number of days, and the amount of work done. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of work done in terms of "man-days." If 8 men work for 6 days, the total work done is:
\[ 8 \text{ men} \times 6 \text{ days} = 48 \text{ man-days} \]

This means the work requires 48 man-days to be completed.

Now, we need to find out how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day. Let's denote the number of men required as \( x \).

The equation for the work done in terms of man-days is:
\[ x \text{ men} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ day} = 48 \text{ man-days} \]

Solving for \( x \), we have:
\[ x \times \frac{1}{2} = 48 \]
\[ x = 48 \times 2 \]
\[ x = 96 \]

Therefore, 96 men are required to complete the work in 1/2 day. The correct answer is:

D)96 men

So, the answer is D.

----- Negative side -----

2. To find out how many men are needed to complete the same work in 1/2 day, we set up the equation:  
   \[ x \text{ men} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ day} = 48 \text{ man-days} \]

3. Solving for \( x \):  
   \[ x \times \frac{1}{2} = 48 \]  
   \[ x = 48 \times 2 \]  
   \[ x = 96 \]

Therefore, 96 men are required to complete the work in 1/2 day. The correct answer is indeed:

To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fractions by multiplying the entire equation by 3:

\[
3 \left(\frac{2}{3}x - 10\right) = 3 \left(40 + \frac{1}{3}x\right)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x - 30 = 120 + x
\]

Next, isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( x \) from both sides:

\[
2x - x - 30 = 120
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x - 30 = 120
\]

Add 30 to both sides to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 150
\]

Therefore, the number is 150. The correct option is:

C)150

The answer is C.

I agree with your solution and reasoning. Let's verify the steps to ensure accuracy:

1. Start with the equation given by the problem:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}x - 10 = 40 + \frac{1}{3}x
   \]

2. Eliminate the fractions by multiplying the entire equation by 3:
   \[
   3 \left(\frac{2}{3}x - 10\right) = 3 \left(40 + \frac{1}{3}x\right)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   2x - 30 = 120 + x
   \]

3. Isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( x \) from both sides:
   \[
   2x - x - 30 = 120
   \]
   Simplifies to:
   \[
   x - 30 = 120
   \]

4. Add 30 to both sides to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 150
   \]

The calculations confirm that the number is indeed 150. Therefore, the correct option is:

C)150

The answer is C.

If 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number the result is equal to sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. Find the number Choose one of the following options: ['A)100', 'B)160', 'C)150', 'D)210', 'E)220']. The response should end with a single uppercase letter.

----- Base Answer -----
Let's denote the number as \( x \).

According to the problem, if 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of the number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. We can write this as an equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3}x - 10 = 40 + \frac{1}{3}x
\]

To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fractions by multiplying the entire equation by 3:

\[
3 \left(\frac{2}{3}x - 10\right) = 3 \left(40 + \frac{1}{3}x\right)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x - 30 = 120 + x
\]

Next, isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( x \) from both sides:

\[
2x - x - 30 = 120
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x - 30 = 120
\]

Add 30 to both sides to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 150
\]

Therefore, the number is 150. The correct option is:

C)150

The answer is C.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the rectangular yard and then calculate the amount of fencing required for three sides.

1. **Identify the dimensions:**
   - Let the length of the yard be \( L \) meters and the width be \( W \) meters.
   - We know one side is 10 meters, so either \( L = 10 \) or \( W = 10 \).

2. **Calculate the other dimension using the area:**
   - The area of the yard is given as 240 square meters. Therefore, \( L \times W = 240 \).

3. **Case 1: \( L = 10 \)**
   - If \( L = 10 \), then \( 10 \times W = 240 \).
   - Solving for \( W \), we get \( W = 24 \).

4. **Case 2: \( W = 10 \)**
   - If \( W = 10 \), then \( L \times 10 = 240 \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = 24 \).

5. **Determine the fencing needed:**
   - Alice wants to fence three sides, leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced.
   - If \( L = 10 \), the fenced sides are \( W + L + W = 24 + 10 + 24 = 58 \) meters.
   - If \( W = 10 \), the fenced sides are \( L + W + L = 24 + 10 + 24 = 58 \) meters.

In both cases, the amount of fencing needed is 58 meters.

Therefore, the correct answer is A) 58.

----- Negative side -----
I agree with your reasoning and calculations. Let's go through the steps again to ensure accuracy:

1. **Identify the dimensions:**
   - We have a rectangular yard with one side measuring 10 meters. This means either the length \( L \) or the width \( W \) is 10 meters.

2. **Calculate the other dimension using the area:**
   - The area of the yard is 240 square meters, so \( L \times W = 240 \).

3. **Case 1: \( L = 10 \)**
   - If \( L = 10 \), then \( 10 \times W = 240 \).
   - Solving for \( W \), we get \( W = 24 \).

4. **Case 2: \( W = 10 \)**
   - If \( W = 10 \), then \( L \times 10 = 240 \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = 24 \).

5. **Determine the fencing needed:**
   - Alice wants to fence three sides, leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced.
   - If \( L = 10 \), the fenced sides are \( W + L + W = 24 + 10 + 24 = 58 \) meters.
   - If \( W = 10 \), the fenced sides are \( L + W + L = 24 + 10 + 24 = 58 \) meters.

In both scenarios, the amount of fencing required is 58 meters. Therefore, the correct answer is indeed A) 58. 

The answer is A.
